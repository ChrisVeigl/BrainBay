<p>This software application enables to upload firmware to Neurobit devices.
It is also possible to read out information about the hardware and firmware from the device.
Wireless communication (Bluetooth or IrDA) with the equipment is used.
The application works under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; operating systems: 2000/XP/2003 Server/Vista/7. </p>
<p>(For Microsoft Windows 95/98/Me/NT please use Neurobit Firmware Loader 2.2 instead.)</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firmware file</b> - filename of binary file of firmware version 
    selected to upload.
  <li><b>Access key</b> - a key string entitling you to a specific upgrade. 
    If a given firmware is made generally available, this field can remain empty.
  <li><b>Link type</b> - type of link used for communication with Neurobit device.
  <li><b>BT address</b> - Bluetooth address of Neurobit device (or name of 
    its communication module). If you have only one turned on Neurobit device
    in the wireless communication range, you can usually leave the default value 
    in this field.
</ul>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Browse</b> - opens a window enabling selection of a specific version 
     firmware file,
  <li><b>Doc</b> - displays documentation of changes in selected firmware version,
  <li><b>Check</b> - reads out hardware and firmware information from the device,
  <li><b>Upload</b> - uploads a firmware to the device,
  <li><b>Help</b> - displays this help for the PC loader application,
  <li><b>Exit</b> - closes the loader application.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrade procedure</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><u>Neurobit Optima</u> devices:<br>
    Bluetooth communication port (built-in into a computer or as a USB adapter)
    compatible with the protocol version 1.1 or newer is required. To install Bluetooth 
    adapter follow an instruction delivered in its package.<br>
    Neurobit Optima device should be set in wireless communication range (usually 
    less than 10m). Before use a Bluetooth device should be paired with your computer. 
    Pairing code for Neurobit Optima is 0000. You can learn more about Bluetooth pairing 
    in Windows help.</p>
  <li><p><u>Neurobit Lite</u> devices:<br>
    Infrared (IR) communication port (built-in into a computer or in form of a USB adapter) 
    compatible with IrDA standard v. 1.0 or newer is required. To install IrDA adapter
    follow an instruction delivered in its package.<br>
    The Neurobit Lite device should be set with IR port oriented towards IR port 
    of your computer, no more than 0.5m from it, without physical obstructions 
    between both entities, preferably on the same axis. There should be no other 
    active IrDA devices (like cell phones) nearby.</p> 
</ul>

<h3>Typical firmware upgrade</h3>
<ol>
  <li><p>Run firmware installer. Package files will be uncompressed 
    ("c:\Program Files\Neurobit\Firmware" is the default directory).
    If there were previous upgrade installations, the existing directory can be used.</p>
  <li><p>Run Winload.exe application from the package directory.</p>
  <li><p>To familiarize with news in a given firmware version (set in <b>Firmware file</b> 
    field) you can click <b>Doc</b> button.</p>
  <li><p>Turn on Neurobit device (and wait a few seconds).</p>
  <li><p>Click <b>Upload</b> button of the application. Information about the hardware 
    and its firmware is displayed. 
    The bar at the bottom of the window indicates firmware transmission progress. 
    The upload usually takes less than a minute.</p>
  <li><p>After successful transmission the new firmware 
    is automatically launched. (In devices having a screen the new firmware name 
    and version will be displayed).</p>
  <li><p>You can now turn off the device and close the loader application.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>If a firmware transmission failed for any reason (like loss of connection between 
    the devices), try to upload the firmware again.</p>
  <li><p>It is also possible to upload older, previously installed firmware versions. 
    You can choose one of installed versions of firmware files clicking 
    <b>Browse</b> button.</p>
  <li><p>If you have more than one turned on <u>Neurobit Optima</u> devices in the communication 
    range, you should indicate an individual device for upload with its <b>BT address</b>.
    In order to list Bluetooth devices previously paired with your computer and their 
    addresses click the Bluetooth icon on the right side of the system task bar and 
    select the option "View Bluetooth devices". (You can select Properties of a selected device 
    and copy its address.)</p>
  <li><p>If <u>Neurobit Lite</u> configuration structure has changed in new firmware version, 
    default configuration is set. It is indicated with an appropriate message on 
    device's display.
    In this case please make again startup settings, as described in the chapter 
    "<i>The basics of usage/Initial configuration</i>" of your equipment instruction 
    manual (especially System/Mains option, according to your country).
    You may also want to set other configuration options then, depending on your 
    preferences.<br>
    For most upgrades the device's configuration is preserved.</p>
  <li><p>You can also consult the chapter "<i>Firmware download</i>" of device 
    instruction manual.</p>
