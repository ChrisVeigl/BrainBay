<p>This software application enables to upload firmware to Neurobit devices.
It is also possible to read out information about the hardware and firmware from the device.
Wireless (Bluetooth or IrDA) or USB communication with the equipment is used.
The application works under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; operating systems: 11/10/8/7/Vista/XP. </p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firmware file</b> - filename of binary file of firmware version 
    selected to upload.
  <li><b>Access key</b> - a key string entitling you to a specific update. 
    If a given firmware is made generally available, this field can remain empty.
  <li><b>Link type</b> - type of link used for communication with Neurobit device.
  <li><b>Device id</b> - Identifier of a Neurobit device. It can be:
		<ul>
			<li>general description of a communication module:
				<ul>

					<li>"<kbd>Serial Port Device</kbd>" - for <u>older Neurobit Optima (without link type suffix in the name)</u>,
				</ul>
			<li>Bluetooth address or
			<li>USB module serial number.
		</ul>
		If you have only one turned on Neurobit device paired with your computer 
		or connected to it via USB, you can use the mentioned generalized 
		identifier in this field.
</ul>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Browse</b> - opens a window enabling selection of a specific version 
     firmware file,
  <li><b>Check</b> - reads out hardware and firmware information from the device,
  <li><b>Upload</b> - uploads a firmware to the device,
  <li><b>Help</b> - displays this help for the loader application,
  <li><b>Exit</b> - closes the loader application.
</ul>

<h2>Device info</h2>
<p>This information appears after connection to a device:

	<li><b>Hardware</b> - device model and serial number,
	<li><b>Transceiver id</b> - communication module identifier, i.e.:
		<ul>
			<li>Bluetooth address or 
			<li>USB serial number,
		</ul>
	<li><b>Bootloader</b> - name and version of bootloader program residing in the device,
	<li><b>Old firmware</b> - name and version of previous firmware,
	<li><b>New firmware</b> - name and version of just uploaded firmware.

</p>

<h2>Update procedure</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><u>Neurobit Optima[+] USB</u> devices:<br>
			A cable with full size USB 2.0 type A plug on one end and micro B plug
			on the other end (the same as for typical cell phone chargers) is
			required. Install driver software for USB chip by FTDI, as described in the
			device quick start guide. Connect the device to the computer and turn it on.
			The computer should detect the device and install necessary USB driver.
		</p>
	<li>
		<p><u>Neurobit Optima[+] BLE</u> devices:<br>
			Windows 8.1 or newer system is required.
			Bluetooth Low Energy communication port (built-in into a computer or as a USB adapter)
			compatible with the protocol version 4.2 or newer is necessary.
			To install Bluetooth adapter follow <i>Neurobit Optima Quick Start Guide</i>.<br>
			Neurobit Optima device should be set in wireless communication range (usually
			a few meters). Before the use a BLE device should be paired with your computer.
			Pairing code for Neurobit Optima[+] is 000000. You can learn more about Bluetooth pairing
			in Windows help.
		</p>
	<li>
		<p><u>Neurobit Optima[+] BT and older Neurobit Optima (without link type suffix) </u> devices:<br>
			Bluetooth communication port (built-in into a computer or as a USB adapter)
			compatible with the protocol version 2.0 or newer is required. To install
			Bluetooth adapter follow <i>Neurobit Optima Quick Start Guide</i>.<br>
			Neurobit Optima device should be set in wireless communication range (usually
			a few meters). Before the use a BT device should be paired with your computer.
			Pairing code for Neurobit Optima[+] is 0000. You can learn more about Bluetooth pairing
			in Windows help.
		</p>
	<li>
		<p><u>Neurobit Lite</u> devices:<br>
			Infrared (IR) communication port (built-in into a computer or in form of a USB adapter)
			compatible with IrDA standard v. 1.0 or newer is required. To install IrDA adapter
			follow an instruction delivered in its package.<br>
			The Neurobit Lite device should be set with IR port oriented towards IR port
			of your computer, no more than 0.5m from it, without physical obstructions
			between both entities, preferably on the same axis. There should be no other
			active IrDA devices nearby.
		</p>
</ul>

<h3>Typical firmware update</h3>
<ol>
  <li><p>Download the latest firmware binary:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.neurobitsystems.com/download/Neurobit_Optima_Plus-firmware.htm">Neurobit Optima+ models and Neurobit Optima USB/BLE/BT devices</a>,
			<li><a href="https://www.neurobitsystems.com/download/Neurobit_Optima-firmware.htm">older Neurobit Optima 2 / 4 models  (without link type suffix)</a>,
			<li><a href="https://www.neurobitsystems.com/download/nl2_9.exe">Neurobit Lite</a>.			
		</ul>
		</p>
  <li><p>Run Winload program:
		<ul>
			<li>from disk or 
			<li>via supported biofeedback applications, in Neurobit device settings 
				window, with <b>Device services</b> button on the <b>General</b> tab.
		</ul></p>
	<li><p>Click <b>Browse</b> to select downloaded firmware file and choose 
		<b>Link type</b> used by your Neurobit device. (If necessary, write down 
		the <b>Device id</b>.)</p>
  <li><p>Turn on Neurobit device (and wait for its beep signal).</p>
  <li><p>Click <b>Upload</b> button of the application. Information about the hardware 
    and its firmware is displayed. 
    The bar at the bottom of the window indicates firmware transmission progress. 
    The upload usually takes less than a dozen seconds for Bluetooth and USB.</p>
  <li><p>After successful transmission the new firmware 
    is automatically launched. It is signalled with a beep.<br>
		(In <u>Neurobit Lite</u> 
		the new firmware name and version will be displayed on device's screen.)</p>
  <li><p>You can now turn off the device and close the loader application.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>If there are several <u>Neurobit Optima[+]</u> devices paired with / 
		connected to your computer, we recommend to turn off all of them but the one 
		intended for firmware update. <br>(Otherwise the updated device should be 
		unambiguously identified with its transceiver identifier set in the 
		<b>Device id</b>.)
  <li><p>If a firmware transmission failed for any reason (like loss of connection between 
    the devices or heavy load of processor), try to upload the firmware again.</p>
  <li><p><a name="severaldevs">If you plan to use several Neurobit devices</a> (having the same link type) with 
		the same computer concurrently, you need to identify each device unambiguously 
		with its transceiver identifier. To be able to do so follow the procedure at 
		the beginning:
		<ol>
			<li>Run the Neurobit loader application (directly or using the <b>Device services</b> 
			button on the General tab of the device settings window).
			<li>Set suitable <b>Link type</b>. In the <b>Device id</b> field leave (or enter) the general identifier "Neurobit Optima*".
			<li>Turn on <u>only one</u> Neurobit device (it should be paired 
				with your computer or connected to it via USB at first). 
			<li>Click the <b>Check</b> button.
			<li>When an identifier appears in the <b>Transceiver id</b> field, write it
				on a label and stick it to the device.
			<li>Turn off the device.
			<li>Repeat points 3-6 for each other Neurobit device.
		</ol></p>
		<p>From now on you can use these identifiers to specify, which device piece will 
		be used in a given instance.
		</p>
  <li><p>If <u>Neurobit Lite</u> configuration structure has changed in new firmware version, 
    default configuration is set. It is indicated with an appropriate message on 
    device's display.
    In this case please make again startup settings, as described in the chapter 
    "<i>The basics of usage/Initial configuration</i>" of your equipment instruction 
    manual (especially <b>System</b>/<b>Mains</b> option, according to your country).
    You may also want to set other configuration options then, depending on your 
    preferences.<br>
    For most updates the device's configuration is preserved.</p>
  <li><p>You can also consult the chapter "<i>Firmware update</i>" of device 
    instruction manual.</p>
</ul>
